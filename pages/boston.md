“Boston's winding streets recall revolution and renewal; even today, this is a forward-thinking and barrier-breaking city. Though you can hardly walk a step without running into some historic site, Boston remains vital, with vibrant artistic scenes, cutting-edge urban planning, and ever-present scholars and thinkers shaping the evolving culture.”
